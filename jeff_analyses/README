# Initial data pre-processing

    * preprocess/json_to_csv.r
        - Take JSON output from JATOS and convert to CSV for further analysis
        - Combines immediate and delayed conditions into one
        - I: data/results_immediate.csv, data/results_delayed.csv
        - O: data/results.csv

    * spelling_intrusions_perseverations.r
        - Correct known spelling errors from misc/snafu_spelling.csv
        - Use misc/snafu_animals.csv to get list of known animals
        - Remove "intrusions" (includes uncorrectable spelling errors and multi-items like 'liontiger')
        - Adds a column to mark perseverations
        - I: data/results.csv
        - O: data/results_clean.csv (with perseverations), data/results_noperseveration.csv (without perseverations)

# Analyses

    * perseveration_analysis.r
        - Are there differences in the number of perseverations across listnum, condition, and age (2x2x2)?

    * num_responses_analysis.r
        - Are there differences in the proportion of repetitions across condition, and age (2x2)?

    * rt_analysis.r
        - Are there differences in the mean response time (or log mean RT) across listnum, condition, and age (2x2x2)?

    * repetition_analysis.r
