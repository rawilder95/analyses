# Initial data pre-processing

    * preprocess/json_to_csv.r
        - Take JSON output from JATOS and convert to CSV for further analysis
        - Combines immediate and delayed conditions into one
        - I: data/results_immediate.csv, data/results_delayed.csv
        - O: data/results.csv

    * spelling_intrusions_perseverations.r
        - Correct known spelling errors from misc/snafu_spelling.csv
        - Use misc/snafu_animals.csv to get list of known animals
        - Remove "intrusions" (includes uncorrectable spelling errors and multi-items like 'liontiger')
        - Adds a column to mark perseverations
        - I: data/results.csv
        - O: data/results_clean.csv (with perseverations), data/results_noperseveration.csv (without perseverations)

    * clustering.py
        - Generates avg cluster size and num cluster switches metrics for each list
        - I: data/results_noperseverations.csv
        - O: data/clustering.csv

# Misc. functions

    * misc/basicplot.r
        - Plot figures with error bars

    * utils.r
        - Functions for various tasks:
            - temporal_clustering_score()
            - lag()
            - lag_crp()
            - repeated_clustering_sizes()

# Analyses

    * num_responses_analysis.r
        - Are there differences in the number of responses across listnum, condition, and age?
        - Significant:
            - Age (YA > OA)
            - Condition * Listnum (Immediate: L1 > L2; Delay: L1 < L2)

    * perseveration_analysis.r
        - Are there differences in the number of perseverations across listnum, condition, and age?
        - Significant:
            - Listnum (L2 > L1)

    * rt_analysis.r
        - Are there differences in the mean response time (or log mean RT) across listnum, condition, and age?
        - Significant:
            - Age (OA > YA)

    * repetition_analysis.r
        - Are there differences in the proportion of repetitions across condition, and age?
        - No

    * repetition_cluster_analysis.r
        - Are repetitions clustered together / does this differ by condition, and age?
        - Significant:
            - Condition (Immediate > Delay)

    * clusters_analysis.r
        - Does semantic cluster size vary by condition and age?
        - "Marginally" Significant (p = .054)
            - Listnum (L2 > L1)

    * old_analyses/temporal_clustering_analysis.r
        - Nothing interesting
