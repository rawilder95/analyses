# For cluster switches 
# How many clusters in this list
# Average size of the clusters
# Start with one of those methods like sim_drop 
fread('clusterswitches.csv')

# All you have to do is change the DV

# Repetition cluster size: How long are the repetition chains, are they more interleaved or all together (e.g. new new new old old old)
